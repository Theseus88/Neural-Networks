# Neural-Networks
This project started simply by wanting to learn a little bit about neural networks. After watching a [video](https://vimeo.com/19569529) by Dave Miller about coding a neural network in c++, I decided to give it a try. You can also read his article [here](https://millermattson.com/dave/?p=54). The neural network I use is the same as in his video. I added a way to archive the neural network and a way to load an archived neural network. I also focused on writing a class for managing an image dataset with different training sessions. I think my code is easy to follow but if you have questions feel free to ask.

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/)

Nicolai Nielson has a good video on YouTube that explains installing and using OpenCV in Visual Studio.

Everything seems to work fine so far and I plan on adding more to it as I have time. A good starting point for anyone needing one.
