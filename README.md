# Nueral-Networks
This project started simply by wanting to learn a little bit about neural networks. After watching a [video](https://vimeo.com/19569529) by Dave Miller about coding a neural network in c++, I decided to give it a try. You can also read his article [here](https://millermattson.com/dave/?p=54). The neural network I use is the same as in the video by Dave Miller. I added a way to archive a nueral network and load an archived neural network. I also wrote a class for managing an image dataset with different sessions. I think my code is easy to follow but if you have questions feel free to ask.

Nicolai Nielson has a good video on YouTube that explains installing and using OpenCV in Visual Studio.
